# AI-Driven Intelligent Ticketing – Enterprise ITSM
---
Modern enterprises handle large volumes of IT incidents and service requests across platforms like ServiceNow, Jira, Zendesk, and Freshservice. This project builds an AI-powered intelligent ticketing system that automates ticket classification, prioritization, routing, duplicate detection, 
and trend analysis. By leveraging machine learning and historical data, the system reduces manual triage, improves SLA compliance, identifies recurring issues, and continuously learns from human feedback to enhance IT operations efficiency.
